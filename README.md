**Notes**

1.	Before getting down to revision, please first make sure you know how to [configure Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [create repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). Mac users can download Git [here](https://desktop.github.com).

2.	Before getting down to revision, please also acquaint yourself with [RST grammar](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html) and the document generator [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

3.	Once you’ve completed your revision, please submit it to the future branch in Wiki repository.

4.	Please make sure to revise the existing files or create new files in docs folder.

**For user not knowing how to use Sphinx, we welcome you participate in the revision of file contents and be concerned about file layout or format. You needless spare your attention to other files in the Wiki folder besides RST files in the docs folder.**

Regarding docs files, please note the following:

1， Don’t delete or edit any file that’s not in RST format, e.g. conf.py, inde.html, Makefile etc.

2， Changes in index.rst files will be directly reflected in file directory.

3， Headings for RST files:

+ ==== symbolizes H1, ---- symbolizes H2 and ~~~~ symbolizes H3. 
+ Changes to headings under  ==== in the index.rst file will alter the general directory.
+ Changes to headings under  ---- and ~~~~ will alter the table of contents in individual RST files.
